# [Project 1 : Customer Behavior Analysis With R](https://www.kaggle.com/gomathimaliga/customer-behavior-analysis-with-r)

* Customer behavior Analysis is a detailed analysis of a companyâ€™s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.
* For this Exploratory Data Analysis work, I have used R which is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
* R Libraries used : Plotly, Dplyr, Data Explorer, Skimr, Ggplot2

I have also created a Tableau Dashboard that provides overview about customer's purchasing habits.
